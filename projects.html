        <h1 id="h1">Reversible Fault Tolerance</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project presents the design of reversible fault tolerant architecture of logic 
            elements of look-up table based Field Programmable Gate Array. The proposed logic 
            elements are master slave Flip Flop, Data-Latch and multiplexer. A new 4×4 and a new 
            6×6 fault tolerant reversible gates are proposed for designing efficient reversible fault 
            tolerant Data-latch, master slave Flip Flop and multiplexer, respectively. The design of 
            the proposed logic elements achieve the improvement of area & delay performance. 
            Finally, the efficiency of the proposed elements is clarified by implementing an n-bit 
            adder using the proposed Configurable Logic Block of Field Programmable Gate Array. 
            This Design is implemented using Verilog HDL and simulated by Modelsim 6.4 c and 
            synthesized by Xilinx tool.

        <h1 id="h1">Shannon Fano Encodig</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shannon-Fano Encoding is a variable-length 
            entropy coding technique used in information theory and data compression. It operates by dividing a set of symbols into 
            two subgroups, assigning shorter codewords to symbols with higher probabilities of occurrence and longer codewords
            to those with lower probabilities. This process is recursively applied to each subgroup, creating a binary 
            tree structure of codewords, ensuring that no codeword is a prefix of another. This unique tree-based approach enables
            efficient data compression by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols, minimizing the average code length and 
            facilitating reliable decoding.
